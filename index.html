      <h2>What You'll Find Inside</h2>
      <p>
        At SchemaTest, we believe learning should be both structured and practical. That's why each subject is split into two powerful modes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lessons</strong> ‚Äì Concise explanations, examples, and strategies for every category</li>
        <li><strong>Tests</strong> ‚Äì Timed practice quizzes modeled after real CSE questions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether you're brushing up on grammar rules or challenging yourself with tricky analogies, SchemaTest gives you the clarity and repetition needed to pass with confidence.
